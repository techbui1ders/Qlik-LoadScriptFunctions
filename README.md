Once you have the application installed, understand the formulas by going to the load script and looking at the functions.

Then move to the front end and see the table for how the function is used.

Hopefully at this point the relationship between the front end and the load script using the '$1' variables is semi-understood. Using load script functions enables standardization and creates additional flexibility from a development perspective. Check out our blog for best practices and additional ways to use the load script functions.
